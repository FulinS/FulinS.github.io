                        <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
                        <p> There are many things that I do for fun in my free time. Some of these include playing the cello, listening to classical music, composing music, looking at math memes, and playing chess. Most of my hobbies provide me with a way to creatively express myself through different means, which I enjoy a lot.
                            As a result of the creative nature of my interests, I have worked on many projects, a few of which can be viewed from the link in the top bar. My most rewarding hobby related accomplishments are the projects created for cs50, which greatly challenged my problem solving skills.
                            To see some of my music, check out the music section on the top bar.

                        <h3>Extracurriculars:</h3>
                        <p>I am involved in a multitude of extracurricular activities both inside my school and out. At school, I have been a part of many organizations such as the student council, pit orchestra, math club, competitive computing club, STEM club, and international crew. Outside of school, I am a part of a local youth orchestra and am a sergeant at my cadet squadron.
                            Moreover, I am taking regular cello lessons and have taken CS50x. During the summer, I have participated in many camps, such as the ITS training course at Vernon CTC for cadets and music related camps.</p>

                        <p>Aside from projects, I have also attained some (I'd say) notable achievements. So far, I have earned multiple of my school's "lead learner" awards in subjects such as math, science, french, and social studies.
                            I am also on my school's "principal's list", which is a testament to the fact that I have maintained an overall average above 90%. Aside from school, I have a RCM level 10 certificate for cello, 2 certificates
                            of distinction from the University of Waterloo's math contests, and a COMPTIA-F certificate. Additionally, I have also obtained an above average score of 51/75 on the University of Waterloo's 2025 Junior Canadian Computing Contest.
