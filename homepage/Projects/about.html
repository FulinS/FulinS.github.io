            <p>Here is some information about this project:</p>
            <p><b>What</b>: This game is a static webpage that I built using HTML, Javasacript, and CSS. I originally planned to make another game, being a text-based adventure web application, however, due to the fact that most web application hosting services charge fees, I decided to make a static website instead.</p>
            <p><b>Why</b>: I chose to create this project over other ideas because I really wanted to challenge myself to apply what I was learning, not just in code, but in other topics as well. In this project, I had to combine several concepts that I have learned, including recursive functions, data structures, and vector spaces, and creatively apply them in a meaningful way.</p>
            <p><b>How</b>: I won't go too much into my implementations, but I tried to use as little HTML as I could, and instead program as much as I could in Javascript. There are 2 reasons. Firstly, Javascript is a very new language to me, as I have just started to learn it a few weeks ago, so I want to practice and familiarize myself with its syntax, and secondly, the webpage needs to constantly display different things based on user input, which HTML can not achieve. </p>
