            <p>Welcome to 4D Tesseractic Tic Tac Toe, a multidimensional game that transcends observable space! In this page, you'll learn how to play the game. The objective of the game is similar to that of regular 5x5 tic tac toe: get 4 of your symbols in a row before your opponent does. The following text provides a more detialed explanation of the rules.</p>
            <p><b>Objective</b>: You want to be able to have 4 of your symbols on the grid in a row. Rows can be completely straight or diagonal, and can span across any combination of the 4 dimensions. Rows will not wrap around the grid ex. (5,5,1,1) and (5,1,1,1) are not in a row</p>
            <p><b>Placing Symbols</b>: The game starts with X (player 1)'s turn. Player 1 can select any of the available grids (ones marked by *) in any of the 4 dimensions by clicking on it. Upon clicking, the * will turn into an X, marking that it belongs to player 1. After clicking, the turn automatically changes to to O (player 2)'s. Player 2 can then click any available grid to claim it. This process continues until a player wins.</p>
            <p><b>Dimensions</b>: This game takes place on a 4d 5x5x5x5 tesseract. Everything on the x and y plane will always be visible, and players can hop through the 3rd and 4rd dimensions using the buttons above the game grid. Players can see the coordinates of grids by placing the mouse over them.</p>
            <p>That's it! The rules are very simple to understand, however, much of the complexity of this game comes from the strategy and multidimensional thinking involved.
