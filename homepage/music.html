                        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                        <p>Music has always been something that I've enjoyed, no matter if I'm listening, playing, or composing it. I have played the cello ever since I was 6 years old, and am currently at an RCM 10 level.
                            Another instrument that I can play but am not good at is the recorder, which I learned from my elementary school's music class. I have played as a pit musician for my school's musical production, and
                            am also a member of a local youth orchestra as well as my school's concert band. I have played at many festivals (both local and international), including one held at San Francisco, which my school's music department performed at.

                        <h3>Compositions:</h3>
                        <p> As I play different styles of music from different eras, I very often get inspired and want to create my own pieces. I have only some knowledge of basic music theory, which
                            may make my compositions be unorthodox, however, I find that through writing music, I get a way to apply my understanding of the technicalities of music, and I become interested in learning more theory.
                            The video shown is an example of a piece that I composed for cello and piano, inspired by 3 composers that I really enjoy listening to and playing. More compositions could be found at my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fulins456/featured">youtube channel</a> or <a href="https://musescore.com/user/38582136">musescore account</a>.

                        <h3>Playing:</h3>
                        <p>Aside from composing music, I also play and perform the cello. Just as the introduction states, I am currently at an RCM 10 level, and I have passed all of my exams with very high marks. Right now, I am learning some 20th century music, as well as some of bach's compositions.
                            I very much enjoy playing Shostakovich's Cello Concerto I in Eb Major, Goltermann's Cello Concerto III in B minor, and Bach's solo cello repetoire. The video is a recording of me playing La Foi by George Goltermann, one of my favourite (and <b>severely</b> underrated) composers.
