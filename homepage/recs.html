                        <h3>Composers</h3>
                        <p>Well known composers are famous for a reason. I get that. Tchaikovsky, Bach, etc. did compose some very impressive music. But besides those giants, there are many criminally underrated composers.
                            I would personally recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPPLoRYMVrw">Borodin</a> for his extremely romantic Russian melodies, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKwLjuqh__W3vgAQfrqP4q3j0FIqBWkh2">PDQ Bach</a> for his musical comedy that always gets a laugh.
                            For some virtuoustic and exciting pieces, I always go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGA7IZDGlulLquuGMNc0lnZPtwgD1le-S">Sarasate's</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWNCbpwC-PQ">Ernst's</a> works. Some more well known composers that I really enjoy are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM9hdCpdcqc">Grieg</a>,
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKTVLpmvznI">Shostakovich</a>, and for operatic music, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfKzML_EbRE">Puccini</a>.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Music</h3>
                        <p>Oh my goodness, there are so many gems in classical music; how could I possibly choose? Ok, I'll try recommend the best ones. For piano music, I really like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghEa1x23low">Gershwin's Piano Concerto</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdgNQN-PiRA">Shostakovich's Piano Concerto II</a>. Both were written in the 20th century, and have some very unique elements. For orchestral works, look no further than the Russians. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5poSw7tFLB4">Marche Slave</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY4w4_W30aQ">Scheherazade</a>
                        are some of the best music ever written. For solo works, I love the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngjEVKxQCWs">Bach Chaconne</a> or his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbH3JYfRjOQ">6th cello suite</a>. For something else baroque, listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4qePY2Wdss">La Folia</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Math</h3>
                        <p>I'm very interested in math, and as a result, I have learned many strange and interesting concepts. Here are some of them. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem">Hairy Ball Theorem</a> states that a hairy ball (more generally an even dimensional n-sphere with a vector field on its surface) will have cowlicks if 'combed'.
                            An interesting is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity">Euler's Identity</a>, which provides a way to express complex numbers in exponential form using the complex polar plane. Lastly,
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">the Fourier Transform</a> is a very interesting tool that allows for the transformation between functions in the time domain and functions in the frequency domain.</p>

                    <div class="infoBoxR">
                        <h3>Operas</h3>
                        <p>If you're looking for something long to watch, why not consider watching an opera? I have some great ones right here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZO2BPS_pOw">The Barber of Seville</a> is a fantastic opera buffa, and the plot is quite simple. As an added bonus, it has some very catchy tunes. For tragedies, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-AkOjdR7Ds&t=6s">La Boheme</a> is a great option. It has all the elements of a good tragic story, and you won't even know it's a tragedy until at least act III.
                        For something unorthodox, definitely check out Shostakovich's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxgjshs6MY">The Nose</a>, a satirical opera that targets the social class during the time of Alexander I. It's really weird.</p>

                        <h3>Books</h3>
                        <p>I sometimes enjoy reading in my free time and there are some books that I found to be especially interesting. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61439040-1984">1984</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170448.Animal_Farm">Animal Farm</a> are perfect if you ever want to feel depressed after finishing a book, not because of poor quality, but because they make you feel utterly hopeless.
                        For something scientific, I recommend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3869.A_Brief_History_of_Time">A Brief History of Time</a> or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23360039-how-to-bake-pi">How to Bake Pi</a>. These two books manage to break down difficult concepts into small digestable pieces. That doesn't mean you won't get a headache from reading these though. I know I sure did.</p>
